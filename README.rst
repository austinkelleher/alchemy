-----------------

Alchemy is a utility and contrib extension to the base TensorFlow library.
It includes `notebooks <https://github.com/wenkesj/alchemy/blob/master/notebooks>`_
and tests for recent research papers and my own RRR (Repeatable Reportable Research) experiments.


Getting started
===============

Installing Alchemy requires pip. After that, you're set. Check out these
`notebooks <https://github.com/wenkesj/alchemy/blob/master/notebooks>`_ that include
detailed examples and implementations of recent research and experiments. All notebooks
were created with `Google Colab <colab.research.google.com>`_ and can be opened and edited
freely!

Developer install
-----------------

To install the latest version of Alchemy (in development mode):

.. code-block:: bash

  git clone https://github.com/wenkesj/alchemy
  (cd alchemy; pip install -e .)
