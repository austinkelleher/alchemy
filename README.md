This repo' contains some code I've used pretty regularly for machine learning. I've been looking
to dump it somewhere remote for easy access in my other projects.

I will keep adding random shared modules that I use for tensorflow and ML tasks.

Feel free to use it, look at the tests for examples/usage, what-not.

As I go, I may scrap some of the code that is redundant and replace it with an outside API as a
dependency.
